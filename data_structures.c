    @see agios_add_request.c 
    Depending on the scheduling algorithm being used, requests will be organized in different data structures. For instance, aIOLi and SJF use a hashtable, TO and TO-agg use a timeline, and TWINS uses multiple timelines. No matter the data structure used to hold the requests, AGIOS will always maintain the hashtable, because it is used for the statistics.
