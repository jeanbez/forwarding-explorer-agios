/*! \file agios_cancel_request.c
    \brief Implementation of the agios_cancel_request function, called by the user to give up of a queued request.

    ALL requests added with agios_add_request must be either notified with agios_release_request (after being processed) or cancelled with agios_cancel_request, otherwise information about them will continue to exist in memory.
