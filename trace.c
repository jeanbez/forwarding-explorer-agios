/*! \file trace.c
    \brief Trace Module, that creates a trace file during execution with information about all requests arrivals.

    Trace files are named according as prefix.N.sufix with prefix and sufix given as configuration parameters and N being a counter. In the initialization of this module, it tries to open trace files with increasing values to N until finding an unused one that will be used as the new trace file. A buffer is used to write information before sending it to disk, in order to avoid generating a large number of small requests to the local storage (and also to minimize the interference with the scheduled requests in case they are also to the local storage). The length of this buffer is also a configuration parameter.
    @see agios_config.c
