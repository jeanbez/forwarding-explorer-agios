AGIOS was developed in the context of the joint laboratory LICIA\footnote{http://licia-lab.org/index-en.html} between the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Brazil, and the University of Grenoble, in France. The research was supported by CAPES-BRAZIL - under the grant 5847/11-7 - and the HPC-GA international project\footnote{https://project.inria.fr/HPC-GA/}. 

Experiments that allowed its progress were conducted on the Grid'5000 experimental test bed, being
developed under the INRIA ALADDIN development action with support from
CNRS, RENATER and several Universities as well as other funding bodies
(see \url{https://www.grid5000.fr}).
